# Website

This repository stores the page code used on a Wix-hosted site. Each file corresponds to a specific page's code panel script so you can keep version control outside the Wix editor.

## Page files
- `home`: Homepage interactions, including responsive pricing switch behavior and multi-audience button group handling.
- `Pricing`: Pricing page logic for toggling billing options on desktop vs. mobile and displaying comparison plans.
- `signUp`: Signup page logic that preselects plans from query parameters, autofills user data, and submits member sign-up requests.

## How to use with Wix
1. In the Wix Editor, open **Dev Mode** to access the page code panel for the corresponding page.
2. Copy the contents of the matching file in this repo and paste it into the page code panel.
3. Save and publish your site to apply the updated behavior.
